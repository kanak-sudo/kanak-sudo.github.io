I taught a semester-long introductory course on scientific computing using Python and R to fresh graduates pursuing their masters in mathematics. The core goal of the course was to communicate how scientific computing libraries like NumPy, SciPy, SymPy and MatPlotLib can be used to efficiently tackle problems arising in the field of applied as well as pure mathematics. The course was structured to lay a special emphasis on themes which are fairly recurrent at the interface of mathematics and computing, namely, numerical linear algebra, analysis of systems of differential equations, symbolic computations, fractal-systems, etc. The open book/internet exam that I set for the course is availiable [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LV8_RnNdKd_IvT-jjFDsbJ0JRi9hkks2/view?usp=sharing).
