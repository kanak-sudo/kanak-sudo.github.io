For the Monsoon '24 semester, I am assisting Prof. Manjil Saikia, and Prof. Alok Shukla with their courses, Combinatorial Enumeration (MAT315/515), and Introductions to Data Structures and Algorithms (CSC210). Course notes for MAT315/515 can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-tCKWRSDAnt2vpGPCBCguElygVmZyMso?usp=sharing) and are updated weekly.
