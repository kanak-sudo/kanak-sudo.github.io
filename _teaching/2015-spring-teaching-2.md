For the Monsoon '24 semester, I am assisting [Dr. Manjil Saikia](https://ahduni.edu.in/academics/schools-centres/school-of-arts-and-sciences/faculty/manjil-saikia/) with his course, Combinatorial Enumeration (MAT315/515). Course notes for the same can be found [here](https://github.com/kanak-sudo/MAT315Notes/blob/main/chapter.pdf) and are updated weekly.
