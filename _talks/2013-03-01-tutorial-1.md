For my masters thesis, which I did with [Dr. Vikram Aithal](https://www.ictmumbai.edu.in/Department_FacultyProfile.aspx?nDeptID=eiaqee), I primarily studied ideas in global and local dynamics admitted by collecting iterated folds of holomorphic self-maps defined on a Riemann surface. A part of this work involved developing a Python package which could (amongst other things) plot Julia sets corresponding to arbitrary maps defined on the extended complex plane. I was invited to [SageDays114](https://wiki.sagemath.org/days114) to present this package, [CDynamics](https://github.com/kanak-sudo/CDynamics). I am interested in, and plan on re-writing the package with a [Julia](https://julialang.org/) backend sometime soon. To see CDynamics in action feel free to run `pip install CDynamics` on your Python environment with [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YyPuGq-1FZq5M8a9zqjZzZnJFJr1jBgo/view?usp=sharing) guide at hand.
