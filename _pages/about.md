My name is Kanak, and I am a second-year PhD student at the Division of Mathematical and Physical Sciences, Ahmedabad University. Broadly (and eventually), I plan to work in the theory of modular forms. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of my academic and professional journey so far:

* Aug 2023 - Present: **PhD in Mathematics and Computational Sciences**, [Ahmedabad University](https://www.ahduni.edu.in), Ahmedabad.
* Jan 2023 - Aug 2023: **Full-Stack Developer, & Designer**, [99x Studio](https://www.99xstudio.com/), Bangalore.
* Aug 2022 - Jan 2023: **Visiting Faculty**, Department of Mathematics, [Institute of Chemical Technology (formerly UDCT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Chemical_Technology), Mumbai.
* Aug 2020 - Apr 2022: **Masters in Mathematics**, [Institute of Chemical Technology (formerly UDCT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Chemical_Technology), Mumbai.
* Aug 2017 - Apr 2020: **Bachelors in Mathematics**, [Mumbai University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Mumbai), Mumbai.

In addition to the standard mathematical texts required for my PhD, I have recently also started enjoying literature around the themes of absurdism and existentialism. *The Myth of Sisyphus* (Albert Camus), *The Metamorphosis* (Franz Kafka), *The Idiot* (Fyodor Dostoevsky), and *Bell Jar* (Sylvia Plath), are amongst my favourite books I've read in the genre so far.
